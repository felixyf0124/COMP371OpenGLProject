1. time 
2. collision detection efficiency (takes a lot of time to cut down unnecessary calculation for collision detection)
3. *shadow (incompleted, no time to debug & compiling)
4. object selection identity detection
5. object movement (based on camera movement & tilting)
6. collision detection algorithm
7. suitable texture maping
8. object loading
